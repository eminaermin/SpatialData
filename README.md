# SpatialData

This project was assigned by my professor where we input in a data file to be plotted on Google Maps or Google Earth. Learning how to code in KML was a trip,
mostly because the documentation was just hard to read, at least for me. It plots the world capital of most countries.

For the most part it works, there are some capitals that won't plot however, and I don't really care too much to go back and fix it.
